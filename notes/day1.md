## Based on nature and response a client server classified into following:
1. Single tier Architecture
![Single tier Architecture](<WhatsApp Image 2025-08-06 at 11.16.41_1b6e83a3.jpg>)
In this clients machine are called dumb terminals as they dont have a processing power of their own.
Advantage : 
It is very easily to design and  implement.
It is less costly.
Disadvantage:
If somehow the server crashes then entire architecture also crashes and all the datas are lost.
2. double tier Architecture

3. third tier Architecture

In this server the server split into two parts
1.web server
2.database server
